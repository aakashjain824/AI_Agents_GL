    "\n",
    "Imagine a financial services company wants to build an internal AI assistant for its analysts. This assistant needs to answer questions about stocks, requiring access to real-time pricing and company information. Instead of embedding API keys or complex data-fetching logic directly into the agent (which might be running in a less secure environment or be harder to update), the company creates a dedicated MCP server.\n",
    "\n",
    "This server securely wraps the necessary functions (like querying Yahoo Finance). The analyst interacts with the AI assistant (the client-side code), which securely communicates with the MCP tool server via stdio to fetch the required data, enabling the assistant to provide informed answers without directly handling the data source interaction itself. This pattern allows for easy updates to the tools (just update the server) and better separation of concerns."

    "1. Goal: Create an LLM-based agent that can answer financial questions using real-time data from Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "2. Challenge: LLMs lack direct, real-time access to external APIs like Yahoo Finance. We need a way to provide this capability.\n",
    "3. Solution Approach: Use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to bridge the gap.\n",
    "    - Server (`yfserver.py`):\n",
    "        - Define Tools: Create Python functions (`get_current_price`, `get_company_info`, `list_popular_tickers`) that use the yfinance library to fetch the required data.\n",
    "        - Expose Tools via MCP: Use the `FastMCP` library and the `@mcp.tool()` decorator to expose these Python functions as callable tools over the MCP protocol. The decorator helps automatically define the tool's schema (inputs, outputs, description) based on type hints and docstrings.\n",
    "        - Run the Server: Configure the MCP server to run and communicate using `stdio` (standard input/standard output). This is a simple transport mechanism suitable for local process communication.\n",
    "    - Client (Main Notebook/Script):\n",
    "        - Configure LLM: Set up the connection to the desired Large Language Model (e.g., ChatOpenAI).\n",
    "        - Launch Server Process: Define how to start the `yfserver.py` script as a separate process (`StdioServerParameters`).\n",
    "        - Establish MCP Connection: Use the `stdio_client` context manager to start the server process and get access to its stdin and stdout streams. Inside this, use the `ClientSession` context manager to establish an MCP session over these streams and perform the initial handshake (`session.initialize()`).\n",
    "        - Discover Tools: Utilize the `langchain-mcp-adapters` library (`load_mcp_tools`) to automatically query the connected MCP server, discover the available tools, and convert them into LangChain-compatible Tool objects.\n",
    "        - Create Agent: Instantiate a LangChain/LangGraph agent (like `create_react_agent`), providing it with the LLM and the dynamically loaded tools.\n",
    "        - Execute Query: Pass the user's natural language query to the agent. The agent will use the LLM to plan steps, decide when to use a tool, invoke the tool (which triggers communication over MCP to the server process), receive the results, and generate a final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Rationale: This architecture decouples the agent's core reasoning logic (LLM) from the specific implementation of the tools. The MCP server acts as a secure and maintainable gateway to the external Yahoo Finance functionality. `stdio` is chosen for simplicity in this example, allowing the client script to directly manage the server process lifecycle. The `langchain-mcp-adapters` library simplifies the integration by handling the MCP communication details and tool conversion automatically."
